*Configuring Libvirt*

Add these settings in /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf and reboot the server.
options kvm_intel nested=1
options kvm_amd nested=1

You need two networks in libvirt:
 - jt_default is going to be used for Internet access in foundation0
     a clone of default libvirt network but with a different subnet (192.168.224.0/24) because foundationX
     also comes with a default network in libvirt and you want to avoid having the same 192.168.122.0/24 subnet.
 - jt_classroom is an "Isolated network, internal and host routing only" *without DHCP* 
     (foundation0 is going to have a DHCP service in this ethernet network)
 
 If you have other storage pools available on your server and you want to use them you will need to modify the
 foundationX XML files.
 I have used the default /var/lib/libvirt/images for foundation0 and /srv/classroom for others because
 classroom is on a separate 3TB nVME drive.
 
 mkdir /etc/pki/CA
 mkdir -p /etc/pki/libvirt/private
 chgrp -R qemu /etc/pki/libvirt/
 chmod 750 /etc/pki/libvirt/private
 copy "CA cert" to /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem
 copy "server cert" to /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem
 copy "private key" to /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem
 chmod 440 /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem
 restorecon -RF /etc/pki
 
 You need to edit /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf and change these settings:
 
 listen_tcp = 1
 tls_no_verify_certificate = 1

 systemctl restart libvirtd
 
 *Configuring qemu*
 
 mkdir /etc/pki/qemu
 cp /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem /etc/pki/qemu/ca-cert.pem
 cp /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem /etc/pki/qemu/server-cert.pem
 cp /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem /etc/pki/qemu/server-key.pem
 restorecon -RF /etc/pki
 
 You need to edit /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf and change this setting:
 spice_tls = 1

 systemctl restart libvirtd
 
 There is a reason to use a CNAME and not A record (hostname of your server)for your certificates.
 SPICE connection will fail if .vv file points the host to 127.0.0.1 where the ports are actually opened,
 because the CN is not correct.
 I solved this by adding the CNAME FQDN to /etc/hosts on the libvirt server to the 127.0.0.1 entry.
 
 I connected to foundation0 with virt-manager running on my workstation over SSH.
 
 *Configuring SQUID proxy*
 Install the package and change the /etc/squid/squid.conf to only allow the whole world to connect to
 localhost ports on the libvirt server where SPICE consoles are available secured with a password.
 
acl SPICE_HOSTS dst 127.0.0.1/32
acl SPICE_CLIENTS src all
acl SPICE_PORTS port 5981-5999
http_access allow SPICE_HOSTS
http_access allow SPICE_PORTS
http_access allow SPICE_CLIENTS
acl CONNECT method CONNECT

#http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SPICE_PORTS

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
http_port 4827

systemctl restart squid

*Configure firewalld*

put the squid.xml file in /etc/firewalld/services/squid.xml
firewall-cmd --add-service=squid

That will take care of allowing SPICE clients to connect with TLS to SPICE console ports that are only bound to
localhost on libvirt server.

*Upload the image of your physical RHTINST USB key to your server*

My USB key was inserted into my notebook and it was presented as /dev/sdc
dd if=/dev/sdc | ssh -i id_rsa.pem user@yourserver \
'dd of=/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhtinst-usb.img conv=sparse status=progress'

*Foundation X domain XML files*

A few notes about them:
You should use virtio-scsi (less prone to become non-responsive and it supports TRIM or discard).
They have a password set for SPICE graphics (change it for your system). I used the same password for all VMs
because the VMs are going away after the week is over and I am going to change the password for other classes anyway.
They change the qemu command so that SPICE allows more than one connection to a VM, which allows me to actually
help the student.
  <qemu:commandline>
    <qemu:env name='SPICE_DEBUG_ALLOW_MC' value='1'/>
  </qemu:commandline>
foundation0 is using 5940 and 5980 (tls)ports
foundation1 is using 5941 and 5981 ports
foundation2 is using 5942 and 5982 ports
...
foundation10 is using 5950 and 5990 ports
...
foundation14 is using 5954 and 5994 ports

* virt-manager and remote-viewer session files (.vv)*

They will instruct the viewer to connect to SPICE over the proxy port. Pay attention to how CA certificate in PEM format
is written as a single string and newlines in PEM file were replaced by "\n". I have lost more time on this than anything else except waiting for USB to upload over 100Mbit/s connection.

Remember to replace my CA with YOUR CA!!!
